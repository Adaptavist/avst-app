Release 0.70, 8th Apr 2022
--------------------------

Added basic support for Amazon Linux

Release 0.69, 3rd Feb 2022
--------------------------

Added support for enabling tomcat access logging for confluence, this is principly controlled via the CONFLUENCE_ENABLE_TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG variable, a value of
1 means that access logging should be enabled and a value of 0 means it should not.

Below are additional avst-app config variables that can be used to set various elements of the logging config, they each have a default value that is also noted:
* TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG_CLASS - Defaults to "org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve"
* TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG_DIRECTORY - Defaults to "logs"
* TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG_PREFIX - Default to "conf_access_log"
* TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG_SUFFIX - Defaults to ".log"
* TOMCAT_ACCESS_LOG_PATTERN - Defaults to "%t %{X-AUSERNAME}o %{User-Agent}i %h %m %r %b %s %D %I"

Release 0.68, 10th Jun 2021
---------------------------

Changed the way commands are run as the instance owner, previously they were run using 'su' and have now been swaped over to use 'sudo'

Release 0.67, 4th May 2021
--------------------------

Expanded the logic that handles Synchrony driver path, previously SYNCHRONY_DRIVER_PATH had to be a fully qualified path to the database driver.
The new logic now checks if the supplied path is a directory, if so it them looks for a single jar within the directory and if founds adds that file, if there are not exactly 1 file in that directory then avst-app errors out.  This will allow for upgrades without needing to hard code each new jar file name.

Adding some additional exit codes to the README.MD, also updated some duplicate codes to use unique values

Release 0.66, 22nd Feb 2021
---------------------------

Added support for setting <schema-name></schema-name> in jira dbconfig.xml if the database type is postgres and a schema name is set.

This is controlled by the DB_SCHEMA_NAME avst-app.cfg.sh variable, the default value of which is nothing and results in the element not being set

In addition the logic to set "validation-query-timeout" for MySQL databases has been extended to any database type starting "mysql" instead of an exact match
for just "mysql", this allows the mysql57 database type to also set the "validation-query-timeout" element


Release 0.65, 26th Aug 2020
---------------------------

Added support for setting maxPostSize in each tomcat connector in bytes, this is controled by the following:
* MAX_POST_SIZE - deafults to 2097152

Additionally it is possible to set the value for each connector individually, the first connector will just use MAX_POST_SIZE, all
additional connectors can be set via MAX_POST_SIZE_FOR_CONNECTOR<connector number>, i.e MAX_POST_SIZE_FOR_CONNECTOR1 (second connector).
If a connector specific value is not set then that connector will fallback to the value of MAX_POST_SIZE

Release 0.64, 14th May 2020
---------------------------

Added support for Bitbucket >= 7.2.0, which ships with ElasticSearch 7.5, the service scripts need to set JAVA_HOME to support the new ES version. The location of JAVA_HOME for the service can be controlled by the below avst-app.cfg.sh variable:
* SEARCH_JAVA_HOME - defaults to /usr/java/latest 

Release 0.63, 28th April 2020
-----------------------------

Modified bamboo/jira "42disable_tomcat_access_logging" logic, added the ability to skip logging management all together, this is usefull as trying to
manage the configuration (either to enable or disable) when the XML element(s) has been removed will cause the XML configuration document to be malformed.  
This functionality is controlled via the SKIP_LOGGING_MANAGEMENT flag, a value of 1 means that logging will not be managed by avst-app, any other value means it will (defaults to 0)

Added support to cleanup plugin caches and the home temp directory on startup in jira and confluence.

This functionality is controlled by two new flags:
* CLEAN_PLUGIN_CACHE - This flag determines if the plugin cache folders are cleared before the application starts, a value of 
                       1 means yes and anything else means no (defaults to 0)
* CLEAN_HOME_TEMP    - This flag determines if the temp directory in home is emptied before the application starts, a value of 
                       1 means yes and anything else means no (defaults to 0)


Release 0.62, 25th November 2019
--------------------------------

Added support to define the timeout of each tomcat connector, a global variable CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT can be used to set the value for 
all connectory, this defaults to 20000.  It is also possible to set the value per connector via the CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_<CONNECTION_NUMBER>
i.e CONNECTOR_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_2 variable

Release 0.61, 2nd August 2019
-----------------------------

Added basic support for Bitbucket DC, this involved:
support to set cluster config params (limited to TCP/IP discover atm) via the following variables
  - CLUSTER_NAME  = The name of the BB cluster
  - CLUSTER_PASSWORD = The password to connect nodes to the BB cluster
  - CLUSTER_PEERS = comma separated list of IP' and ports of each nodes, i.e 192.168.12.1:5701,192.168.12.2:5701

support to disable the in-build elastic search instance, this stops it being started, configured as a server
and also from being a dependent service for the main bitbucket service, this is controlled by the variable ENABLE_ELASTICSEARCH:
  - 1 = enable in-built ES, as per previous functionality
  - 0 = disable in-built ES, do not install ES service and do not make it a dependency of the bitbucket service
  currently this flag *only* has any affect at install/upgrade time, it does not have any affect on modify operations

support to configure an external elastic search instance, the following controlled via the following parameters:
  - ELASTICSEARCH_CONFIGURE_REMOTE = flag to determine if external ES is in use, values are:
    - 0 = not in use, will attempt to remove any remote ES parameters from properties file
    - 1 = in use, will attempt to add the any of the remote ES params that have values
    - -1 = ignore, this ignores the config, leaving bitbucket.properties in whatever state its currently in
  - ELASTICSEARCH_URL = URL of the remote ES instance
  - ELASTICSEARCH_USER = Username to connect to the remote ES instance
  - ELASTICSEARCH_PASS = Password to connect to the remote ES instance
  - ELASTICSEARCH_AWS_REGION = For AWS SaaS ES instances, this identifies the AWS region they are running in



Release 0.60, 7th June 2019
---------------------------

Improved configurability of tomcat server.xml:
* Added mail based JNDI object timeout
* Made useBodyEncodingForURI and maxHttpHeaderSize configurable per connection

Added support for ElasticSearch 6.5 on Biutbucket 6 and higher


Release 0.59, 8th March 2019
----------------------------

Modified the tomcat set timeout logic to also manage the app timeout in the Jira, Confluence and Bamboo web.xml files, 
if requested to do so.  The following new parameters are introduced:

MANAGE_TOMCAT_AND_APP_SESSION_TIMEOUT - falg to determin if app web.xml is modified (0=no, 1=yes)
APP_SESSION_TIMEOUT - timeout for the app web.xml, if not set defaults to TOMCAT_SESSION_TIMEOUT (or current app default if not set)


Release 0.58, 29 Febuary 2019
